It's best to follow along with the .md files on GitHub or with something else that displays their formatting correctly.  
The other files are more useful on your local machine.  

Start with [writing-a-smart-contract.md](writing-a-smart-contract.md) or [using-geth.md](using-geth.md).  
Once you've made it through both, you'll be ready for "contract-deployment-and-web3.md".  
Enjoy!
