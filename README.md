# ethereum-101

Download the latest release of Geth (1.4.10 as of writing this) for whatever platform you'll be using: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases

Then follow the instructions for running a full node on Ethereum's test network: https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum#full-node-on-the-ethereum-test-network The important thing for now is getting the test chain synced.
